## 10/8/2025 - #1-Stated off with Baseplate and cube rails   

#1

Today I built the very first foundation and backbone of my CubeSat-the baseplate and cube rails according to national CubeSat standards designs: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/62193b7fc9e72e0053f00910/1645820809779/CDS+REV14_1+2022-02-09.pdf. 2U structure's dimensions are 100x100x227mm and will be made by aluminum 6061-T6 which is generally preferable for CubeSats. Baseplate will serve as the foundation and cuberils will serve for deployment purposes. Stay tuned for updates!!

## 10/9/2025 6 PM - #2 Battery Holders  

#2

Yo Guys battery holder is ready to be fit in the CubeSat which will be the heart of it, and powering it, currently I built half structure to keep batteries and other one will seal it. It is made for 4 cells and 2 packs like this are goanna be established in the CubeSat. Stay tuned for modifications and making it modular.![Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fc40ae0d82cde95fb1c9f6ca9cade889951e28ac/Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)

## 10/9/2025 10 PM - #3 Making Battery holders Modular  

#3

My quest was left half, made the battery holders modular and easily fixed in the CubeSat structure, 8 cells are to be placed there, the spaces at the edges are placed for a battery PCB connecting them all and through a connector, it will be connected to the power board.

## 10/11/2025 10 AM - #4Dipole Antenna Deployers  



#4

The deployer will hold our antenna for data transmission safe during launching. We have chosen Tape measure antenna for our use of 433MHz frequency and 70cm wavelength. Our mechanism for deploying in burn wire mechanism in which we will give voltage to nichrome wire, which will bure and due to tension in tape measure caused by folding will deploy the antenna. A hook like structure is made for the wire to seize antenna before deployment.

## 10/11/2025 12 PM - #5 Radiation tolerant Case for PCBs  

#5

as a necessity, there exists a radiation tolerant PCB case integrated for 5 boards namely, power, RF, RF antenna, avionics and magnetorquer board. It is made 3mm thickness, which is enough to be protected by radiation as it will be inside the CubeSat not exposed, a special place made for the antenna deployers to fix at the bottom as shown in the section view, it will fit. ![Screenshot_11-10-2025_115711_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e58431133a1f83f6e28344504efc301c71eb20a3/Screenshot_11-10-2025_115711_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - #6 Making modular Baseplate and Cube rails  

#6

Some Changes were needed for the CubeSat to be modular and build-up friendly. Just made walls for support of cases. All the corners are there with 3*3mm squares which will act like rail just like the cube rails are. All the cases will do down the rails and fixed at the bottom.

## 10/11/2025 10 PM - #7 Integrating PCB Case with battery holders  

#7 

Integrated battery holder with radiation tolerant PCB case. A plate is inserted in between them for screws which I will make for whole satellite. For modulation space is kept open between them for wires and cable coming through the holder and the solar panels too. Trust me guys integrating 2 objects took longer than expected due to some dimensional errors as well as mate forms.
