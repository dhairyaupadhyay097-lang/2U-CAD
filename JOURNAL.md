## 10/8/2025 - #1-Stated off with Baseplate and cube rails   

#1

Today I built the very first foundation and backbone of my CubeSat-the baseplate and cube rails according to national CubeSat standards designs: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/62193b7fc9e72e0053f00910/1645820809779/CDS+REV14_1+2022-02-09.pdf. 2U structure's dimensions are 100x100x227mm and will be made by aluminum 6061-T6 which is generally preferable for CubeSats. Baseplate will serve as the foundation and cuberils will serve for deployment purposes. Stay tuned for updates!!

## 10/9/2025 - #2 Battery Holders  

#2

Yo Guys battery holder is ready to be fit in the CubeSat which will be the heart of it, and powering it, currently I built half structure to keep batteries and other one will seal it. It is made for 4 cells and 2 packs like this are goanna be established in the CubeSat. Stay tuned for modifications and making it modular.![Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fc40ae0d82cde95fb1c9f6ca9cade889951e28ac/Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)
