## 10/8/2025 - #1-Stated off with Baseplate and cube rails   

#1

Today I built the very first foundation and backbone of my CubeSat-the baseplate and cube rails according to national CubeSat standards designs: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/62193b7fc9e72e0053f00910/1645820809779/CDS+REV14_1+2022-02-09.pdf. 2U structure's dimensions are 100x100x227mm and will be made by aluminum 6061-T6 which is generally preferable for CubeSats. Baseplate will serve as the foundation and cuberils will serve for deployment purposes. Stay tuned for updates!!
