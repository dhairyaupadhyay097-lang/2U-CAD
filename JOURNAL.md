## 10/8/2025 - #1-Stated off with Baseplate and cube rails   

#1

Today I built the very first foundation and backbone of my CubeSat-the baseplate and cube rails according to national CubeSat standards designs: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/62193b7fc9e72e0053f00910/1645820809779/CDS+REV14_1+2022-02-09.pdf. 2U structure's dimensions are 100x100x227mm and will be made by aluminum 6061-T6 which is generally preferable for CubeSats. Baseplate will serve as the foundation and cuberils will serve for deployment purposes. Stay tuned for updates!!

## 10/9/2025 6 PM - #2 Battery Holders  

#2

Yo Guys battery holder is ready to be fit in the CubeSat which will be the heart of it, and powering it, currently I built half structure to keep batteries and other one will seal it. It is made for 4 cells and 2 packs like this are goanna be established in the CubeSat. Stay tuned for modifications and making it modular.![Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fc40ae0d82cde95fb1c9f6ca9cade889951e28ac/Screenshot_9-10-2025_18516_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)

## 10/11/2025 10 AM - #4Dipole Antenna Deployers  



#4

The deployer will hold our antenna for data transmission safe during launching. We have chosen Tape measure antenna for our use of 433MHz frequency and 70cm wavelength. Our mechanism for deploying in burn wire mechanism in which we will give voltage to nichrome wire, which will bure and due to tension in tape measure caused by folding will deploy the antenna. A hook like structure is made for the wire to seize antenna before deployment.

## 10/11/2025 12 PM - #5 Radiation tolerant Case for PCBs  

#5

as a necessity, there exists a radiation tolerant PCB case integrated for 5 boards namely, power, RF, RF antenna, avionics and magnetorquer board. It is made 3mm thickness, which is enough to be protected by radiation as it will be inside the CubeSat not exposed, a special place made for the antenna deployers to fix at the bottom as shown in the section view, it will fit. ![Screenshot_11-10-2025_115711_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e58431133a1f83f6e28344504efc301c71eb20a3/Screenshot_11-10-2025_115711_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - #6 Making modular Baseplate and Cube rails  

#6

Some Changes were needed for the CubeSat to be modular and build-up friendly. Just made walls for support of cases. All the corners are there with 3*3mm squares which will act like rail just like the cube rails are. All the cases will do down the rails and fixed at the bottom.

## 10/11/2025 10 PM - #7 Integrating PCB Case with battery holders  

#7 

Integrated battery holder with radiation tolerant PCB case. A plate is inserted in between them for screws which I will make for whole satellite. For modulation space is kept open between them for wires and cable coming through the holder and the solar panels too. Trust me guys integrating 2 objects took longer than expected due to some dimensional errors as well as mate forms.

## 10/12/2025 - #8 Top Plate  

#8

Just made the top plate today which will be closed at the last, after completing the assembly. Holes are made for screws to attach top solar panel as well as cube rails to it, those cave like structure are made for deployment of solar panels using the same burn wire and tape measure mechanism. It was fascinating to build.

## 10/13/2025 - #9 Radiation hardened cover for Camera   

#9

Guys, I was waiting for do this one as I felt it the most satisfying thing in this whole project. I made the Radiation hardened cover for my cam which is GoPro hero 10 barebones. It is made in two parts, the case and the cover, screws are designed for its mount as well as connecting them both. integrated and minimal designs you can see there for whole cam including buttons, one thing remaining was the space for cable to come out for power and image transmission, will do it later.

## 10/14/2025 - #10 Screw with Standoffs and Nuts  

#10

Yo guys, today I made a Hex Bolt, standoffs of different length according to the need and their nuts, for my satellite which are M3 by specifications, at some places, M2 are also used for minimalism. This is the smallest thing made for the satellite and can be called as a connecting pillar.

## 10/16/2025 - #11 Magnetorquers  

#11

Yo guys, I made the structure for my magnetorquers. Magnetorquers are used for orientation of the CubeSat on 2-axis for taking over control on camera facing and also max. power point, the sun facing one, these can be controlled via MGT. The materiel used will be different, most probably Mn-Zn ferrite, which will work for gaining magnetic field.

## 10/19/2025 - #12 Integration of Baseplate and Cube rails with Camera case  


#12

Hmm, just an integration of Baseplate and Cube rails with radiation hardened Camera case. Dug some holes for screws to add it on and made a lens size carved out area on the wall for lens to come out and take pictures, video etc. Some other cuts will also made on the wall for other objects too.

## 10/20/2025 - #13 Top plate with baseplate  

#13

Guys, top plate is now set with baseplate to hold long solar panels on 4 sides and one on the top, with the assembly arranged. Some cuts are made on the wall for deployment mechanism for solar panels which is same as the dipole antenna one, extension on the wall is also made to attach top plate with baseplate with M3 screws.

## 10/24/2025 - #14 Making the base plate as lighter as a feather  


#14

Ayo guys, long time break for Diwali, today I just made some holes or big caves on the baseplate so that our tiny fingers can work inside and can get a view of that thing, it is done roughly as many things will be changing there for sure for deployment mechanism, screwing it up lol, and ya shielding it from UV rays. And guess what, somethings big for it is coming up soon!!![Screenshot_24-10-2025_15365_cad.onshape.com.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTA2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c1708c5983af956e34f705692f8dcfbec4ca4c24/Screenshot_24-10-2025_15365_cad.onshape.com.jpeg)

## 10/25/2025 3 PM - #15 Full Side Solar panels   

#15

Guys, this post made a lot of crap in my mind, although I completed all the solar panels to b place on the side panels of the satellite. you refer it like this:

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM5MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5a33f7c5220b330aa8654e6bea22312e4753da4c/image.png)

The purpose of making whole panels on PCB was nothing but Cost!!, we found many ready to use solar panels, but they were way too expensive-about 3 times our whole CubeSat budget. 
Here I use SM141K10TF https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/anysolar-ltd/SM141K10TF/14311415?msockid=29b7086329956da600e61d8b280e6c96 as our solar cell, you can see that here, placed 8 on every side, generating 6.91 Volts at 9.8A, which is good as it will cross 10 when top panel is developed.
You can s=also see an NTC thermistor for monitoring temperature on the surface of the panels.

Cuts for deployments are also made.
One thing to mention that I will PCBA this so the connector will be placed on the back not on the on the top, top will remain flat. Connecter is for thermistor and those pas are for solar power.
This whole R&D, Building PCB, finding Solar cell, making it dimensionally correct (may change in integration with CAD), and all the stuff took me not more than 8.5 hours!!!

  

## 10/25/2025 9 PM - #16 Small integration  

#16 

Started off with small integrations, made the whole satellite modular made my heart full of satisfaction.
I built the standoff from baseplate to PCB case for holding it upright along one axis as it is fixed, pressed by wall on another axes. it is like a sliding function. Walls are going to be absent to reduce weight, and for the sake of thermal stability, we are going to use heat coils, and also MLI for insulation and UV protection.

## 11/4/2025 - #17 Here Comes the Battery PCB  

#17 

Ayo guys, it's been a while, hasn't it? no worries i am back with my battery PCB  to be placed in the gaps made before on the design of battery holder, particularly this PCB will connect all +ve and -ve connection of battery and the connecter at the end of the PCB will go to the power board. After many research on C rating, power required (consumption) I have chosen this battery https://robu.in/product/samsung-inr18650-35e-3500mah-2c-li-ion-battery/#tab-specification
for the CubeSat, you may DM me in Slack for more info.
